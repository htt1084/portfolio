The function extract_frames_from_video.py helps extract frames from a video.

The parameter 'frameRate' takes in a positive integer, which is how many images needs to be extracted second (per preferrably between 1 to 24, since, well, you don't need more than 24 frames per second). 
For example, for a 30 seconds video, if you want 30 images,
1 would be your frameRate. If you want 90 images then 3 would be your frameRate.
