Project: Cluster DNA sequences using Fourier Power Spectrum

Project description: Designed and implemented Power Spectrum-Moment method to classify genomes and genes using Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and power spectrum. Performed cluster analysis to analyze biological sequences using PS-M, improved speed up to 15 times while keeping accuracy on several cases. Written in Matlab.
