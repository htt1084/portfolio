Project: Implement a Java application the game Tetris using the Java Swing Libraries. Make use of Inheritance and Design Patterns. 

Project Description: Tetris is a real time game that continuously drops pieces (called Tetrominoes) on to a pile. The user is allowed to rotate and move these pieces left and/or right to fill up rows in the pile. When a row is completely filled, that row disappears and all pieces on top of that row fall down. Over time, the tetrominoes fall faster and the game is over when the pile reaches to the top of the playing area.
