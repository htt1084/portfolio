Project Name: Digit Classification with Backpropagation Implementation. 

Project Description: Implemented backpropagation algorithm with gradient descent from scratch. 
	Designed and trained a 1-hidden layer (784 x 50 x 10) neural network to 
	classify MNIST dataset with 60000 training images and 10000 testing images. 
	Achieved 95% accuracy on testing data. Written in Matlab.
