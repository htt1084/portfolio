Project: Splice sites detection using chaos game representation and neural network

Project description: We propose to use chaos game representation and neural network for splice sites detection. DNA sequences are mapped to numerical sequences using chaos game representation. Numerical sequences are used as feature inputs to neural networks for splice sites classification.
