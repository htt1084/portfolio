Project: Implement the game Mine Sweeper using Java Swing Library, make use of Recursive function.

Project Description: Create a playing grid of 10x10 buttons. All 100 of the buttons will have no text displayed on the button. The game begins with the program randomly placing 10 mines "under" 10 of the 100 buttons. The game is over when either the player left clicks on a button containing a mine (the player loses) or when the 90 buttons that do not have mines have been cleared (the player wins).
